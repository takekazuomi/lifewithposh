## About ten years ago

   I changed my mind. I switched from cygwin to PowerShell(posh).

   Real Programmers Don't Use cygwin.

## A hard life began

Posh is too bad for interactive shell compare to bash.

- No emacs like keybinding.
- Too much poor completion.
- Long command name
- Broken alias. Example: curl, diff 

Following problem is not cause by Posh. cause by Windows. but critical.

- Many many application append own path into PATH environment.

## For ten years since then, I survived.

Survival tool

- psreadline 
- psenv
- remove-alias -force
