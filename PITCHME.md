## About 7 years ago. 
(in 2010)

I switched from cygwin to PowerShell (posh). 

I changed my mind.

Real Programmers DON'T USE cygwin.


(#｀Д´)ﾉﾉ┻┻;:'､･ﾞ

---

## Why not cygwin.

- broken fork
- peer performance
- native exe compatibility

and more 

---

## Why not Bash On Windows.
(WSL)

At that time it was not there.

orz....

---

## A hard life began

Posh is too bad for interactive shell compare to bash.

- No emacs like keybinding.
- Too much poor completion.
- Long command name
- Broken alias. Example: curl, diff

---
## and more
## PATH HELL

- Many many application append own path into PATH environment.

Problem is not cause by Posh, it's by Windows. 

But critical for console favorite people.

I call this "PATH Hell". It is something like [DLL Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell)

### For ten years since, I survived. Because ..

- PSReadLine
- psenv
- remove-alias -force
- ConEmu
- cd bookmark(homemade)
- ps envdir(homemade)

### <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine">PSReadLine</a>

A bash inspired readline implementation for PowerShell.

```
Set-PSReadlineOption -EditMode Emacs
```

Extreamly superb cmdlet. I have no life without this. Something like beer. 🍻

Now PowerShell 5.0 bundle PSReadLine. Good Job!

## <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DuFace">PsEnv</a>

Environment variables management cmdlet. For avoid conflict.

For ex. In my default console don't include any VisualStudio PATH. After start posh, execute following command for set VS environment.

```
use vs140
```

When I want vs 2017.

```
use vs150
```

---

## <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DuFace">PsEnv</a> + Tab completion

I made PR for Tab completion in Feb. 

```
use vs<tab>
vs110  vs120  vs140  vs150  vs90

```

In this case, I use posh <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/core-powershell/console/using-tab-expansion">TabExpansion</a>.
TabExpansion is powerfull. 🍣

---

## remove-alias -force

Just remove broken alias in Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1. 

```
Remove-Item -Path alias:curl -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force
Remove-Item -Path alias:diff -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force
```

Make my life happy. 😆😆😆😆
